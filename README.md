Project goal:

The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

Background:

TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

Scenario:

The data team at TikTok is close to their goal of building a model to assist in the classification of claims in videos. The next step is to use the project data to create a regression model. As a member of TikTok’s data team, you'll determine the type of regression model that is needed and develop one using TikTok's claim classification data.

Course 5 tasks:

Import relevant packages and TikTok data

Exploratory data analysis and check model assumptions

Determine the correct modeling approach

Build the regression model

Background on the TikTok scenario 
At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company, and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

Project background
TikTok’s data team is working on the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed at this stage of the project:

Team members at TikTok
Data team roles
Willow Jaffey- Data Science Lead

Rosie Mae Bradshaw- Data Science Manager

Orion Rainier- Data Scientist

The members of the data team at TikTok are well versed in data analysis and data science. Messages to these more technical coworkers should be concise and specific.

Cross-functional team members
Mary Joanna Rodgers- Project Management Officer

Margery Adebowale- Finance Lead, Americas

Maika Abadi- Operations Lead

Your TikTok team includes several managers, who oversee operations. It is important to adjust your general correspondence appropriately to their roles, given that their responsibilities are less technical in nature.
